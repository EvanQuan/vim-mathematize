# :sunrise_over_mountains: vmath-plus

This plugin allows you to do simple math on visual regions. It is an
extension of Damian Conway's [vmath
plugin](https://github.com/thoughtstream/Damian-Conway-s-Vim-Setup/blob/master/plugin/vmath.vim).

Here is a video demonstrating the original plugin from OSCON 2013:

I have two main goals for this plugin:

1. Add extra functionality on top of the already implemented
   sum/average/min/max in vmath.
2. Avoid recursive key mappings, and expression mappings. I like my `nnoremap`
   and `vnoremap` and hate having to change them to accommodate for plugins.

1. Add `Plug 'EvanQuan/vmath-plus'` to your vimrc file.
2. Reload your vimrc or restart.
3. Run `:PlugInstall`

#### [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)

1. Add `Plugin 'EvanQuan/vmath-plus'` to your vimrc file.
2. Reload your vimrc or restart.

3. Run `:NeoUpdate`

#### [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EvanQuan/vmath-plus.git ~/.vim/bundle/vmath-plus
```

## Usage

This plugin provides 4 functions:
- `g:vmath_plus#analyze()`
- `g:vmath_plus#analyze_buffer()`
- `g:vmath_plus#report()`
- `g:vmath_plus#report_buffer()`

By default, they are not mapped to anything so you can map them to whatever you
like. I personally use:

```vim
" Analyze
"
xnoremap <silent> <leader>ma y:call g:vmath_plus#analyze()<Return>
xnoremap <silent> <leader>mba y:call g:vmath_plus#analyze_buffer()<Return>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>ma vipy:call g:vmath_plus#analyze()<Return>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>mba vipy:call g:vmath_plus#analyze_buffer()<Return>

" Report
"
noremap <silent> <leader>mr :call g:vmath_plus#report()<Return>
noremap <silent> <leader>mbr :call g:vmath_plus#report_buffer()<Return>
```

### Analyze

`g:vmath_plus#analyze()` calculates the numbers in your current visual
selection (visual/line/block mode). As shown, I have normal mode mapped to
calculate the numbers in the current paragraph.

For example, if you were to visually select the following numbers and call
`g:vmath_plus#analyze()`:

```
1
1.0
4
```

The following result would be echoed to the screen:

```
s̲um: 6   a̲vg: 2.0   min̲: 1   max̲: 4   m̲ed: 1.0   p̲ro: 4   r̲an: 3   c̲nt: 3   std̲: 1.732051
```

These values are then stored in the following registers:

| Register | Value              |
|:--------:|:------------------:|
| s        | sum                |
| a        | average            |
| n        | minimum            |
| x        | maximum            |
| m        | median             |
| p        | product            |
| r        | range              |
| c        | count              |
| d        | standard deviation |

which can be pasted with `"<register>p` in normal mode.

`g:vmath_plus#analyze_buffer()` does the same thing but prints the result in
a small read-only buffer at the bottom of the window instead of echoing it.
The buffer is persistently open until you manually close it, and lets you copy
and paste portions of it as you please.

### Report

`g:vmath_plus#report()` reports the results of the most recent analysis. Since
the values are only temporarily echoed, it can be useful to go back and see
previous results without having to recalculate them or manually check the
register contents.

The report message is dynamically calculated based on the window width at the
time of the report. Spacing is increased to expand the window, and if wide
enough, the value labels are expanded to their full names.

`g:vmath_plus#report_buffer()` does the same thing but prints the result in
a small read-only buffer at the bottom of the window instead of echoing it.
The buffer is persistently open until you manually close it, and lets you copy
and paste portions of it as you please.

### Report variables

The last analysis results are stored in global variables for you to do whatever
you want with them, such as making your own commands or functions. They are as
follows:

```
g:vmath_plus#sum
g:vmath_plus#average
g:vmath_plus#minimum
g:vmath_plus#maximum
g:vmath_plus#median
g:vmath_plus#product
g:vmath_plus#range
g:vmath_plus#count
g:vmath_plus#stn_dev
```

If you manually change these values, subsequent report function calls will
still output the correct report values. These values are also updated to their
proper values after any `vmath_plus` function call.

### Buffer settings

By default, For the buffer functions `g:vmath_plus#analyze_buffer()` and
`g:vmath_plus#report_buffer()`, the report buffer resizes to fit only the text
of the report to be as unobtrusive as possible. If you do not want the buffer
to be resized, you can disable it in your `vimrc` with:
```vim
let g:vmath_plus#resize_buffer = 0
```

The report message expands to fit the window width in both the
label spacing and in the label abbreviations. The aim is to the make the
message both more readable for wide windows and to prevent it from overflowing
to multiple lines for small windows and thus creating an annoying `Press ENTER
or type command to continue` prompt.

By default, the report buffer uses the same message as the echoed report.
However, since it does not suffer from the single-line constraint as the echoed
report, there is no need to shorten it. If you would like the report buffer to
always use full labels no matter the window width, you can disable buffer label
resizing in your `vimrc` with:
```vim
let g:vmath_plus#resize_buffer_labels = 0
```

Similarly, the minimum buffer spacing can be adjusted if resizing is disabled
with:
```vim
let g:vmath_plus#min_buffer_gap = 2
```
By default it is set to 2, meaning that the buffer label spacing will either be
2 or greater if `g:vmath_plus#resize_buffer_labels = 0`. Non-positive gap sizes
will be readjusted to 1.
